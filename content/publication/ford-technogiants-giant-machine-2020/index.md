abstract: "The relationship between humankind and technology is fundamental, but also\
  \ a longstanding source of unease, particularly as that relationship has become\
  \ ever more intimate and irreversible. In this paper, I connect this age-old anxiety\
  \ with the age-old figure of the giant, a monster similarly intertwined with ancient\
  \ questions on the boundaries of humanity. I focus on two examples: the Human-Reaper\
  \ larva in Mass Effect 2 and Liberty Prime in Fallout 3 and 4. Although different\
  \ in approach, these examples demonstrate a use of a phenomenon I call the `techno-giant'\
  \ to explore and reflect the powerful anxieties in our cultures to do with the future\
  \ of the human– technology relationship. In particular, both examples expose the\
  \ human– nonhuman boundary as being exceeding difficult to define and place, despite\
  \ a constant desire to. The figure of the giant offers a powerful focal point for\
  \ these representations."
