abstract: Using the Dark Souls series as an example, I examine how a frame of `monster
  of excess' can be used to read giantness in digital games. The monster of excess
  finds a paradigmatic example in the giant, an age-old mythic figure still prevalent
  within digital games. Many elements are directly borrowed or translated from other
  artistic forms such as film and literature. But, in this paper, I focus on how excess
  is encoded ludically, and how that links with the more representational and aesthetic
  depictions of excess within the games. I find that elements such as the camera and
  the game's interface, along with the player-character are all affected by giantness,
  with giants seeming to exist in excess of the games' established frames.
