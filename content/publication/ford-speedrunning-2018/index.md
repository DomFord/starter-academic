abstract: 'In textitHow To Do Things With Videogames, Ian Bogost argues that videogames
  offer “an experience of the ‘space between points’ that had been reduced or eliminated
  by the transportation technologies that began with the train” (2011, 49). But when
  we watch a speedrun of a game such as textitThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
  (Nintendo EAD 1998), what we instead see is a player determined to destroy as much
  of that ‘space between points’ as possible. It is a game that takes most players
  tens of hours to complete, but is finished in just over 17 minutes by the best speedrunners,
  utilizing glitches that manipulate the game’s code to skip enormous chunks of both
  the narrative and the gameworld. Once an underground hobby conducted between users
  swapping footage on obscure internet forums, speedrunning has shot into the mainstream
  in recent years following the rise of livestreaming platforms and livestreamed events
  such as Games Done Quick and the European Speedsters Assembly. So what does speedrunning
  mean as a mode of play, and what can it reveal about the relationship between player
  and gameworld? This paper examines speedrunning as a transgressive mode of play.
  Building on previous work on this topic by scholars such as Rainforest Scully-Blaker,
  I first aim to define speedrunning as a practice and then to explore its relationship
  with the space in the gameworld, the game’s narrative, and with the ideological
  and representational implications that arise from them. To do this, I bring in spatial,
  digital and videogame theorists such as Paul Virilio, Tom Apperley and Espen Aarseth,
  as well as work on other transgressive spatial practices such as parkour in order
  to see if and how they relate.'
