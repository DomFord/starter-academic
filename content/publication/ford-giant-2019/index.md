abstract: 'Too monstrous to be truly accepted, too human to be entirely and comfortably
  cast out. The giant has traditionally held a unique position amongst monsters, an
  \"Intimate Stranger\" (Cohen, 1999, p. xi) who threatens the boundaries of the categories
  we impose upon the self, society and culture. In this thesis, I consider what the
  position of the giant is in digital roleplaying games and how digital games provide
  a new and particular arena for the giant. A familiar figure in myth and legend and
  no less familiar in digital games, I combine traditional monster theory and scholarship
  on giants with work on videogame monsters and digital game research more broadly.
  To do this, I first introduce the figure of the giant and its definition and then
  undertake a brief literature review, summing up the present state of videogame monster
  research and other theories which are relevant to my thinking and arguments. Then,
  I consider the giant in digital roleplaying games through three lenses. First, as
  monsters of excess, a perspective that considers giants as an exaggerated manifestation
  of those traits which we deem monstrous when taken to their extremes. Second, as
  technological giants: giant robots, cyborgs and so on whose appearance as giants
  links the age-old figure of the giant with our more current anxieties regarding
  our future and our increasingly intimate relationship with technology. Finally,
  as aspects of nature: giants that seem to be more a living part of the gameworld
  than as a horrifying and excessive human monster. I explore how these giants seem
  to relate more to how we think of and understand our relationship with nature, from
  its sublime beauty to its hostile wildernesses. To conclude, I attempt to draw these
  perspectives together to gain an oversight on what role the giant plays within digital
  roleplaying games, arguing that the giant is a particular figure used to consider
  and work through our socio-cultural anxieties at the most fundamental level and
  is one that requires medium-specific consideration within game studies.'
