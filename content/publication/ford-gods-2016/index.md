abstract: "This dissertation aims to situate moral play under a structure of godhood.\
  \ This comprise two distinct but intertwining elements: the player-as-god and diegetic\
  \ gods. The player-as-god is a concept I will outline that describes the player-avatar\
  \ relationship as a dualistic notion that encompasses the avatar as a distinct,\
  \ diegetic character, and the player as a controlling being who transcends the gameworld.\
  \ The two collide in player-avatar relationships to create a ‘fantasy self’, as\
  \ Katherine Isbister terms, that is neither solely player nor avatar. The player-as-god,\
  \ as both transcendental but simultaneously native to the gameworld, must forge\
  \ new moral and social frameworks according to the different ontological and cosmological\
  \ fundamentals of the created gameworld. These frameworks, I will argue, are predicated\
  \ on higher diegetic powers that guide and inform the player-as-god. I will examine\
  \ this topic through four case studies. In textitGrand Theft Auto V, I will illustrate\
  \ the player-as-god as part of a player-avatar relationship that involves a pre-characterised\
  \ avatar, in the form of textitGTA V's playable protagonists. In textitThe Elder\
  \ Scrolls V: Skyrim, I will analyse a more ‘blank slate’ avatar in the player-avatar\
  \ relationship, and consider how the player-as-god is directed by diegetic gameworld\
  \ gods and higher powers. In textitDiablo III, I will explore the highly intertextual\
  \ nature of its moral framework, as it borrows extensively from Judeo-Christian\
  \ tradition. Finally, in textitDark Souls I will add a moral dimension to Daniel\
  \ Vella’s notion of the ludic sublime, examine how moral futility is instituted\
  \ in the game’s lore and mechanics."
