abstract: textitCivilization V as one of the most successful and definitive works
  of the 4X videogame genre presents a clear narrative of empire-building that, I
  will argue, is problematic when set against postcolonial theory. With many studies
  lauding the series for its educational capacities I argue that with an affective
  turn to the role of the player, the game’s homogenization of narratives of societal
  progression reinforces a Western-centric notion of history. This co-opts non-colonial
  societies into imperialism, while in the process silencing their histories. For
  this study, I will read the game’s goals and mechanics through postcolonial theorists
  such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Michel-Rolph Trouillot, and then turn to
  affect theory to consider what role the player takes in writing this history. To
  conclude, I will consider what implications this has on the use of 4X games like
  Civilization V for education and the conception of history in the minds of the players,
  drawing on other recent scholars who have similarly problematized the series.
